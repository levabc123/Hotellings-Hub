Commodity Hubs are usually small areas, where the delivery of a trading standard has to take place. An example is the WTI crude oil contract (to be delivered in Cushing/Oklahoma).

But the concept can be generalized to wide spatial areas, if the ratio of transport costs to varioius areas from the source of the commodity is stable. It requires then, that the trading standard contract defines
these ratios and that the price of the commoditiy depends where it is finally delivered.

The following software allows to keep track of all possible delivery sites (database) and display them anonymized in circles on a published map.
Each circle displays the deviations from typical average transport costs F. 
It is then possible to construct a "securization" (known from finance) of contracts of physical delivery and to create a Market Place, where one and the same contract is traded. The final commodity price in each region will depend on the 
chosen delivery area by a formula like F=PxM+F(1+fi), where
P: price per unit
M: units (may be restricted to full truck load)
F: basis freight
fi: freight deviation by delivery area
